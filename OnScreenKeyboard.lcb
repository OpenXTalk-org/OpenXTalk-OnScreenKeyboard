Name: keyDown

Type: message

Syntax: keyDown pKey

Summary: sent when a key is press on the keyboard while the widget has focus

Example:
on keyDown pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do keyDown && pKey in me
end keyDown

Description:
The keyDown message is sent by the scripting engine, not from Extension Builder VM,
when a key is press on the keyboard. When the cursor enters the widget the widget
becomes the focusedObject and traversalOn is set to true, which are needed for
the widget to respond to input from the keyboard.


Name: keyUp

Type: message

Syntax: keyUp pKey

Summary: sent when a key is released on the keyboard while the widget has focus

Example:
on keyUp pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do keyUp && pKey in me
end keyUp

Description:
The keyUp message is sent by the scripting engine, not from Extension Builder VM,
when a key is press on the keyboard. When the cursor enters the widget the widget
becomes the focusedObject and traversalOn is set to true, which are needed for
the widget to respond to input from the keyboard.

Name: commandKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: commandKeyDown pKey

Summary: sent when a key is press on the keyboard while the widget has focus

Example:
on commandKeyDown pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do commandKeyDown && pKey in me
end commandKeyDown

Description:
The commandKeyDown message is sent by the scripting engine, not from Extension Builder VM,
when a key is press on the keyboard. When the cursor enters the widget the widget
becomes the focusedObject and traversalOn is set to true, which are needed for
the widget to respond to input from the keyboard. Note that there is no commandKeyUp
coorisponding message sent, wHen the on commandKeyDown handler is used the input
acts like a momentary switch. Use keyDown,keyUp, rawKeyDown, rawKeyUp in
conjunction with the commandKey() function for more control.

Name: optionKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: optionKeyDown pKey

Summary: sent when a key is press on the keyboard while the widget has focus

Example:
on optionKeyDown pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do optionKeyDown && pKey in me
end optionKeyDown

Description:
The optionKeyDown message is sent by the scripting engine, not from Extension Builder VM,
when a key is press on the keyboard. When the cursor enters the widget the widget
becomes the focusedObject and traversalOn is set to true, which are needed for
the widget to respond to input from the keyboard. Note that there is no optionKeyUp
coorisponding message sent, wHen the on optionKeyDown handler is used the input
acts like a momentary switch. Use keyDown,keyUp, rawKeyDown, rawKeyUp in
conjunction with the optionKeyDown() funcion for more control.

Name: altKeyDown

Syntax: altKeyDown pKey

Type: message

Example:
on altKeyDown pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do altKeyDown && pKey in me
end altKeyDown

Name: controlKey

Syntax: controlKey pKey

Type: message

Example:
on controlKey pKey
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do controlKey && pKey in me
end controlKey

Name: functionKey

Type: message

Syntax: functionKey pKey

Summary: sent when a function key is press on the keyboard while the widget has focus

Example:
on functionKey pFkeyNum
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do functionKey && pFkeyNum in me
end functionKey

Description:
The functionKey message is sent by the scripting engine, not from Extension Builder VM,
when a key is press on the keyboard. When the cursor enters the widget the widget
becomes the focusedObject and traversalOn is set to true, which are needed for
the widget to respond to input from the keyboard. Note that wHen the on functionKey
handler is used the input acts like a momentary switch. Use rawKeyDown and rawKeyUp
for finer control over functionKeya input.

Name: rawKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: rawKeyDown pKeyCode

Example:
on rawKeyDown pKeyCode
   --- use 'do' 'in widget' to pass the key input message into the keyboard widget
   do rawKeyDown && pKeyCode in me
end rawKeyDown

Type: message

Syntax: rawKeyUp pKeyCode

Example:
on rawKeyUp pKeyCode
